# TopCoder Quake Challenge Code

- Code dump for earthquake challenge. 
- Neural network for predicting earthquake event. 
- Python, Java, C++, awk, and bash. Fun times.
- Based code from online tutorial on deep learning.
- Used Theano for speedy things.
- Fast Fourier transform and derivative of time series data for input.
- Ended up with a zero score. Needed more time to process data and fit. Oh well.
